BUGS:
input:
* dungeons: always return to current dungeon lvl with "run"


output:
	* a function to bold / stylize chat messages, like the shopkeeper // old man
	* a uniform way of presenting sentences on the screen (since the game_win width may vary)

bugfixes:
	elements can go to -1 in a fight
		* players don't die from elemental imbalance, but lose consciousness or something
		* game over for the day, has to rest some hours (6? 12? 24?)
		* elements balance themselves over time
